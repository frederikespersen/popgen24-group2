We started by finding the number of clusters to test for. 
We choose minimum K of 3, and the choice of maximum K was done looking at the number of regions in `sample_popinfo.tsv` with following code: 

```bash
# Finding number of maximum cluster
tail -n +2 sample_popinfo.tsv | cut -f1 | sort | uniq | wc -l
```
Then we wanted to evaluate which K is best for admixture. Therefore, we ran admixture 1 time for each K

```bash
# For admixture evaluation - Running admixture (K in 3-7)

# Assumming K number of ancestral populations
for K in {3..7}
do
   # Run admixture with seed 1
   admixture -s 1 AF.imputed.thin.bed ${K} > AF.imputed_K${K}_run1.log

done

# Show the likelihood of all the runs (in a sorted manner):
grep ^Loglikelihood: *K${K}*log | sort -k2
```
Afterwards, `evalAdmix` was used on each K file.

```bash
# Copying visFuns.R to admixture folder
cp -r visFuns.R /science/groupdirs/jmz230/SCIENCE-BIO-popgen_course-project/Group2_ArcticFox/admixture/

# Running evaluation of admixture output to find optimal K
# Assumed K number of ancestral populations
for K in {3..7}
do
   # Run evalAdmix on admixture output files
   ./evalAdmix -plink AF.imputed.thin -fname AF.imputed.thin.${K}.P -qname AF.imputed.thin.${K}.Q -o K${K}.output.corres.txt

done
```

Evaluating the fit of admixture analyses: value of K (done for each `K${K}.output.corres.txt`)
```R
# Read in plotting functions
source("visFuns.R")

# Read in the population info
popinfo <- read.table("sample_popinfo.tsv", header = TRUE)
pop = as.vector(popinfo[,1])

# Read in the output 
r <- as.matrix(read.table("K3.output.corres.txt"))
plotCorRes(cor_mat = r, pop = pop, title = "Correlation of residuals (K=3)", max_z=0.15, min_z=-0.15)
```
Afterwards, we ran admixture 10 times for eack K = 3 to 7.

```bash
# For K in 3 to 7, run 10 admixture

# Assumed number of ancestral populations
K=3

for i in {1..10}
do
   # Run admixture with seed i
   admixture -s ${i} AF.imputed.thin.bed ${K} > admix_K${K}/AF.imputed.thin.K${K}_run${i}.log
   
   # Rename the output files
   cp AF.imputed.thin.${K}.Q admix_K${K}/AF.imputed.K${K}_run${i}.Q
   cp AF.imputed.thin.${K}.P admix_K${K}/AF.imputed.K${K}_run${i}.P
   echo "Run ${i} done"
done

# Show the likelihood of all the 10 runs (in a sorted manner):
cd admix_K3
grep ^Loglikelihood: *K${K}*log | sort -k2
```

Following code was used to make admixture plot of K equal to 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 taking the best run out 10.
```R
# Margins and colors
par(mar=c(7,3,2,1), mgp=c(2,0.6,0))
palette(c("#E69F00", "#56B4E9", "#D55E00", "#999999", "#66CC00", "#CC0066", "#9999FF"))

# Load sample names
popinfo <- read.table("sample_popinfo.tsv", header = TRUE)
region_names <- popinfo$Region

# Read sample ancestral proportions
snp_k <- as.matrix(read.table("AF.imputed.K7_run4.Q"))

# Ensure row names of snp_k correspond exactly to region_names
rownames(snp_k) <- popinfo$Sample

# Get the order of region_names
order_indices <- order(match(region_names, unique(region_names)))

# Reorder the rows of snp_k
snp_k_sorted <- snp_k[order_indices, ]

# Barplot with sorted data using the given colors
barplot(t(snp_k_sorted), col=c(7,6,5,4,3,2,1), 
        names.arg=region_names[order_indices], cex.names=0.8,
        border=NA, main="K=7 - Run 4", las=2, ylab="Ancestry proportion")

```
